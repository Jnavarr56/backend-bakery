# Back End Bakery
Experiment in using CSV files as back end databases for a product catalog with a functional cart and account login portal.

### Used:
- JS
- CSS
- HTML
- Ruby
- Sinatra
- EmailJS

### Description:
*This project uses CSV files rather than SQL based files as databases to store product information as well as
information on on user accounts.*

*I opted for this because at the time I lacked substantial back end knowledge wanted
to flex CSV manipulation skills.*

*Homepage aesthetic features bright colors, eye-catching animations, and smooth scrolling.

### Features:
- Home page with interesting animations that come into view when scrolling.
- Smooth scrolling with navigation links that change color, tracking scroll position.
- Login portal that allows users with accounts in account "database" to login.
- Catalog page that "remembers" users' past cart configuration by reading and writing to account csv files.
- Sends email "receipt" to user when "purchase" made.
