# Back End Bakery
Experiment in using CSV files as back end databases for a product catalog with a functional cart and account login portal.

### Technologies:
- Sinatra
- Ruby
- JS
- CSS3
- HTML5

### Description:
*This project uses CSV files rather than SQL based files as databases to store product information as well as
information on on user accounts.  I opted for this because at the time I lacked substantial back end knowledge wanted
to flex CSV manipulation skills.*
